The East of Lotjang Prabang— Notes of Travels — Observa-tions from Bangkok to Laos — End of the Journal — Deathof the Traveller. The dress of the Laotians differs little from that of theSiamese. The people wear the langouti and a little redcotton waistcoat, or often nothing at all. Both men andwomen go barefoot: their head-dresses are like theSiamese.

It is situated in a narrow valley, like all thetowns and villages through which I have passed since Ileft Chaiapume. This is the district of Siam richest in minerals; oneof its mountains contains immense beds of magnetic ironof a remarkably good quality. Others yield antimony,argentiferous copper, and tin.

So Gods missionaries toil on in obscure andunobtrusive work in foreign fields, rivetingsouls to Christ and to each other, and bring-ing them into organized relations in anticipa-tion of coming service to the kingdom ofChrist. The process goes on until in someauspicious hour Providence knocks away thestays, and the accomplished work leaps intorecognition as a divinely christened achieve-ment. The world is suddenly convinced thatmissions are a power, or its criticism at leastis silenced. Professed Christians who have,perhaps, taken little interest in the matterbefore, are both amazed and delighted.Those at home who have prayed and given infaith, and those abroad who have toiled andwaited in patient sacrifice, alike have theirreward.

It is impossible to state the exact population of Bangkok,the census of all Eastern countries being extremely im-perfect. It is estimated, however, at from three to fourhundred thousand inhabitants. Owing to its semi-aquaticsite, we had reached the centre of the city while Ibelieved myself still in the country; I was only unde-ceived by the sight of various European buildings, and thesteamers which plough this majestic river, whose marginsare studded with floating houses and shops.

No regular banking facilities are provided for theinterior of the kingdom, but the Government isusually prepared to sell drafts on district treasuries,for the convenience of traders and others, at a smallcharge for commission. This privilege is readilyavailed of at times, and may be regarded as thegerm of one phase of the functions of the futureNational Bank of Siam.
